## How the roadmap changes

- A step starts: its status becomes `started` in `docs/data/roadmap.json`, in the first pull
  request of the step.
- A step ships: `done`, with the slug of its post and the number of its pull request.
- A thread claims a step by writing its title as the step's `owner` (and `started`), in a small pull request merged
  before it starts, so no step is done twice. *Done when* is the test the step must pass.
- The plan changes: steps are added, split or dropped here, and the post of the step that
  caused the change says why.
