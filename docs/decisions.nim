## The decision records, docs/decisions/index.html: every choice a later session could make
## another way, one Markdown file each in docs/decisions/ (`NNNN-slug.md`: a front matter with
## title, status and date, then Context, Decision, Consequences). The page finds them itself.
## Kept up to date: a record is added in the pull request that makes the decision.
